# Flask Blog Project

This project is a Flask-based blogging platform that allows users to register, log in, create, edit, and delete blog posts. Users can also comment on blog posts, and the platform features an admin-only functionality for managing posts and comments.

### User Authentication
- **Register**: Users can register with a name, email, and password. Passwords are hashed using `Werkzeug` for secure storage.

### Blog Post Management

- **Edit Posts**: Admin users can edit existing blog posts.

- **View Posts**: All users can view blog posts.

### Comment System
- **Post Comments**: Logged-in users can leave comments on blog posts.
- **Delete Comments**: Admin users can delete any comment.

### Admin Functionality
- Only users with an `id` of `1` (default admin user) have access to create, edit, or delete posts and comments.

### Additional Features
- **Gravatar Integration**: User avatars are displayed using `Flask-Gravatar`.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Blog content and comments support rich text formatting using `Flask-CKEditor`.
- **Form Validation**: User inputs are validated using `WTForms`.
- **Sanitization**: Blog content is sanitized using `bleach` to prevent XSS attacks.
